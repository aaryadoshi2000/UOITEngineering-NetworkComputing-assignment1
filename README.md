File Sharing Application

Environment: - Python 3.9.9(3.5+) with libraries (threading, socket, os, collections, platform, mimetypes)

How to Run

In the project 1 zip, there is one file server.py with two client folder client1 and client2. Client1 and client2 has “file” folder and c1.py (client script) file.

1. Simply run the server.py to start the server.
python3 server.py 

2. Parallelly go to client 1 and client 2 and run c1.py file of both and hence client will start. It will create a “file” folder directly, put the files you want under this directory. (For the comfort, I have already put the files in the “file” folder, then you can simply add those files while running the client). 
Python3 c1.py

Note: - On the server side, it will show received requests and status of server. On client side, it has an interactive menu to interact with it, to simply enter the no. of choices.
